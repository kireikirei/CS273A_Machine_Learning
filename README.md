# CS273A_Machine_Learning
CS273A ML final projects
The purpose of this project is to develop classification models that can accurately predict whether the
income of an individual is over 50K per year by exploring and analyzing the Adult dataset. In this
project, we will conduct various visualization to explore the data. Moreover, we will perform data
preprocessing, feature selection, model training and selection to figure out the appropriate classification
model which has the best performance in predicting income based on the available data.
